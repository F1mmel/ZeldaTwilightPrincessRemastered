## Project goals

Our primary goal is to deliver a polished remastered version of *Twilight Princess* that exceeds expectations. Key enhancements include:

- Modernize visuals, lighting, and environments using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (HDRP in the future)
- Improve controls and camera for smoother gameplay on modern systems
- Introduce quality-of-life improvements and UI refinements
- Full HD Compatibility
- Preserve the nostalgic atmosphere while enhancing immersion

### Target Version

Our initial focus is the **GameCube USA** version, considered the definitive base for *Twilight Princess*. Once this version is complete, we plan to extend compatibility to:
